            Hi, I'm Daniel - the creative behind Iceman Media Photography. 
            I capture moments that matter, whether it's roaring engines, soft sunlight, or joyful faces.
            Photography is my passion and storytelling is my lens.
        </p>
        <p>
            I specialise in a wide range of photography 
            from commercial and vehicle shoots to intimate family sessions and nature landscapes. 
            I bring years of experience and a personal approach to every project I take on.
        </p>
